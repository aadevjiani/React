Respected Teacher,

I would like to thank you for giving us opportunity to learn highly demanding "Web & Mobile Hybrid App Development" in such a interactive way.

I completed all projects of HTML, CSS and Javascript but, unfortunately trapped in some crises and couldn't continue.

But, I have not yet given up and will strive to go through all lectures and will grab the course again

Despite you extended timelines multiple times it will not be fair to request again for the same but, as per your vision I will not loose the hope and will complete the course by viewing the lectures uploaded.

Thanks once again. I will not let your mission and vision let down.
